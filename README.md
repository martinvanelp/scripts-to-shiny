Scripts to Shiny
================

This Shiny app shows that the results of simple data manipulation "scripts" can 
be plotted in a generic fashion. 

It works as follows:

1. The app scans for scripts in the *scripts* folder.
2. A script contains some manipulated data, and meta information about what and
    how to plot.
3. The different scripts can be selected with an input field in the sidebar of
    the app.
4. Once selected, the app plots the the data as "scripted" in the main panel.

The app can be seen in action at:
